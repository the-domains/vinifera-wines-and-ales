description: "The onset of the New Year is a time to look ahead for many, with resolutions made and goals set. But it also offers a chance to reflect. Here, it's time to look back fondly at the whiskey we lost in 2015, and to examine the ongoing occurrence of whiskey vanishing from store shelves going into the future."
