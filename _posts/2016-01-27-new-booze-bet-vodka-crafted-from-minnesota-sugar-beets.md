description: "Minnesota is the number one sugar beet-producing state in the country. It should follow that we would be distilling some of that bounty into booze. BĒT Vodka (pronounced \"beet\") is Minnesota's first vodka distilled from 100% sugar beets ( L'etoile Vodka from Du Nord Craft Spirits is distilled from a mix of sugar beets and corn)."
